The duet shaped as a musical conversation brings forth the nuances and intricacies of heartbreak in a delightfully poignant manner.

    #CokeStudio10
    
    With the force of 7 female voices singing, this rendition of Ghoom Taana is emotionally-stirring piece that siphons the musical energies of Salman Ahmad in it’s truest form. Laced with his signature guitar tones and musicality, the song is an appeal to light in the time of darkness. Momina Mustehsan’s sweet, crystalline tone paired with the incredible chorus of the young girls from Irteassh create an anthem for the ages.

    What is a dhamaal without a solid groove? Shuja Haider paints this evergreen kalaam with fresh, vibrant colors through a tight percussive section and warm, grooving bass. Jabar Abbas’s pristine timbre and lush modulations woven with Umair Jaswal’s textured vocal stylings makes for the perfect ingredients for this emotional, high-energy rendition. The goonj of the percussions finds itself resonating with the urgent pounding of the heart as an anthemic chorus of humnawa and backing vocalists color the soundscape with the drive of the kalaam. With a playful pocket and an intricately designed arrangement, the rendition serves to elevate its listeners to another realm.

    Song Name: Sab Maya Hai
    Produced & Directed by Strings
    Music Directed by Shuja Haider
    Lyrics by Ibn-e-Insha, Shakir Shuja Abadi, Mazhar niazi, Farooq Rokhri & Shuja Haider
    Originally composed by Attaullah Esakhelvi
    
    Bringing the sounds of the soil to Season 10, Attaullah Esakhelvi & Sanwal Esakhelvi narrate a sordid tale of the depravity that is found within the realms of the material world. Attaullah Esakhelvi’s unique yet familiar folk tone is brutally apt in depicting the pain of coming to terms with the illusions that surround us. Shuja Haider creates a unique soundscape by pairing this with the soft yet electric energy of Sanwal Esakhelvi’s tone. Upon a backdrop of groovy and emotive backing vocals, accented with the banjo and flute, this song is a journey towards uncovering the truth.

    Coke Studio Season 10 | Episode 4
    Song Name: Latthay Di Chaadar
    Produced & Directed by Strings
    Music Directed by Shani Arshad
    Latthay Di Chaadar, originally composed by Khalil Ahmed & lyrics by Bashir Manzar
    Dekh Tera, originally composed by Niaz Ahmed & lyrics by Muhammad Nasir
    ‘Latthay Di Chaadar’ & ‘Dekh Tera’ licensed by EMI Pakistan
    
    Colors seem more vivid in this song as a traditional South Asian wedding song blends with an 80s pop track in Shani Arshad’s latest concoction. An upbeat track nuanced with the rhythm of dandiyaan and a gliding flute, the song is further embellished by the fact that it is a duet. Farhan Saeed’s warm, tuneful take on ‘Dekh Tera’ paired with Quratulain Balouch’s textured, radiant voice belting out Latthay Di Chaadar makes for the perfect mixture. With a strong backing vocals section, the song finds itself exploring the musical spectrum of our vibrant traditional past.

    Lyrics by Faiz Ahmed Faiz
    Licensed by EMI Pakistan
    
    Bringing an avant-garde aesthetic to the Coke Studio landscape, Mekaal Hasan’s debut as a music director finds him taking a classic ghazal and framing it with progressive and experimental tropes. Unleashing his signature sound, courtesy of a lush guitar tone and Ahsan Pappu’s emotive flute-playing, Hasan creates a carefully constructed soundscape fitting for the themes of rapture and cruelty that Faiz touches upon in his poetry. The silvery vocals of Humera Channa paired with the honeyed tone of Nabeel Shaukat’s voice make for a fantastic combination to take on this humble tribute to Malika-e-Tarranum, Noor Jehan.

    Entrancing, enthralling and ethereal, Strings’ rendition takes Laal Meri Pat past the threshold of a zealous dhamaal and places it into an ambient and spiritually opulent sonic environment. Arieb Azhar’s baritone spoken word juxtaposed with Akbar Ali’s haunting alaaps steer the song into a beautiful auditory vista as Quratulain Balouch’s unrestrained and captivating persona in the song adds to the trance of the reverie with each emphatic zephyr of dama-dam.  A multi-faceted and nuanced blend of devotional poetry, fervent chants of ‘Jhulelal’ perched upon a dreamy, psychedelic soundscape of the sitar and a traditional groove, the rendition is rich with emotion and mysticism.

    Coke Studio Season 9 | Season Finale
    Song Name: Rang
    Kalaam of Ameer Khusro
    Music Directed by Shani Arshad
    Produced by Strings
    In all its melodramatic glory, and approximately 40 years ago, a shrine echoed with the sound of a traditional qawwali performed in an epic collaboration by the maestros, Ghulam Farid Sabri with Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. The divine kalaam of Amir Khusro – ‘Rang’ – soared through the skies. In what has been deemed as the most anticipated performance of Coke Studio’s Season 9, the two families return to the platform for the first time since, as Rahat Fateh Ali Khan and Amjad Sabri collaborate to perform the very track, four decades later.
    
    Recorded in the first and only take, as the song’s melodic heart unfolds Rahat’s vocals float over the top, forging ahead into well-known territories. With the rasp of Sabri’s rumbling vocals fuelled by a momentary key change, combining the sounds of the past and the present whilst igniting the sense of nostalgia most gracefully – carrying you off to somewhere else entirely. Embodying the classic traditional essence, the kalaam comes alive enriched by the raw, soulful inflections warming your heart and soul for many more decades. #CokeStudio9

    Sublime, beautiful, and soul stirring are all words best to describe ‘Tera Woh Pyaar’ and ‘Nawazishein’ performed by Momina Mustehsan with Asim Azhar. The romantic ballads, both originally sung by Shuja Haider, features him as the music director, calling the shots in a track that truly delivers from the heart. The soft piano and the subtle sound of the sitar create a fitting atmosphere for Momina’s soft vocals, sung with utmost grace, as Asim croons over cinematic violins about the love story, packed full of emotions. Midway through the duration, as the track gathers momentum, it brings together elements of the Pakistani pop scene of the bygone era, and takes you to a dreamy place whilst celebrating romance and leaving one smitten. #CokeStudio9

    Coke Studio Season 9 | Episode 2
    Song Name: Afreen Afreen
    Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan was one of the shining lights of Pakistan, a Qawwali Shahehshah whose talent was heralded both locally and globally. To celebrate the legend that still lives 19 years on, Coke Studio presents
    Afreen Afreen, Rahat Fateh Ali Khan & Momina Mustehsan, Episode 2, Coke Studio 9
    
    Music Directed by Faakhir Mehmood
    Produced by Strings
    The beautifully crafted ‘Afreen Afreen’ sung two decades ago by the legendry, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan still holds the strength to serenade the audience with its poetic and soothing sensibilities. The reformation of the track on Coke Studio – arranged by Faakhir Mehmood and performed by maestro Rahat Fateh Ali Khan and debutant, Momina Mustehsan – transforms the Qawwali seamlessly into an unplugged track. Within the genre, the atmosphere of the song remains ambient and acoustic, as the bare minimum elements give room to Rahat’s majestic vocals to improvise the mastery he possesses. Momina enters the song as she punctuates the additional melody with her laid-back effortless velvety vocals. Towards the end, the track is perfectly complimented with the incredible drum roll and a hyper groove as the traditional ‘Afreen Afreen’ chants are delivered with heartfelt emotion and melodic panache.
